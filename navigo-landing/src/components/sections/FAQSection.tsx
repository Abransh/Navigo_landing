      question: "How does Navigo ensure the safety of travelers?",
      answer: "Safety is our top priority. We thoroughly vet all local companions through background checks, verify their identities, and collect reviews from past travelers. Our platform also features real-time location sharing, emergency assistance, and a 24/7 support team dedicated to resolving any issues immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "Who are the local companions and how are they selected?",
      answer: "Our local companions are primarily students and young professionals who are passionate about sharing their culture. They undergo a rigorous selection process including background checks, language proficiency tests, cultural knowledge assessments, and in-person interviews. Only about 20% of applicants are accepted to ensure the highest quality experience."
    },
    {
      question: "What languages do the companions speak?",
      answer: "All Navigo companions are fluent in English and their local language(s). Many also speak additional languages such as French, German, Spanish, Japanese, or Mandarin. When matching companions, we prioritize language compatibility with your needs."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does the service cost?",
      answer: "Our pricing is transparent and competitive. We offer flexible packages based on your needs - from hourly assistance to full-day companionship. The typical rate ranges from â‚¹800-1500 per hour ($10-18 USD), with discounts available for longer durations. Our pricing includes all service fees and taxes, with no hidden charges."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I book a companion for multiple days?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Many travelers book companions for their entire trip. We offer special packages for multi-day bookings with significant discounts compared to daily rates. You can either book the same companion throughout your journey or different companions in each location you visit."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I need to cancel my booking?",
      answer: "We understand travel plans can change. Cancellations made 48 hours or more before the scheduled meeting time receive a full refund. Cancellations within 24-48 hours receive a 50% refund. Cancellations less than 24 hours in advance are non-refundable, but we do offer one free rescheduling within the next 30 days."
